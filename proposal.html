    <h1>Yvonne Jiang's Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>My website is about products that creatively combined traditional Chinese culture into product design. 
        I will show some of the products I like on the website and then explain the cultural implications behind the product designs. </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?
        My website will teach the audience how can traditional culture be integrated into modern product designs. 
        The audience can also learn more about Chinese culture on my website.

        My target audience will be people who are interested in either Chinese culture or creative products.
