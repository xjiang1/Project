      <h4>Product Description</h4>
      <p>
        This product is both a ruler and a bookmark. It is made of copper, and
        it is about 12.3cm wide and 4.8cm long. It can function as a normal
        ruler because it has measurements on it. It can also be used as a
        bookmark by clipping on the top of the book. A perfect gift for students
        and anyone who likes to read.
        <br />
        The ruler is designed in the shape of mountains and rivers similar to
        the Qian Li Jiang Shan Tu. The use of green and blue to depict the
        mountains are very similar to the original painting.

      <h4>Traditional Elements</h4>
      <p>
        The design of this ruler/bookmark originates from the famous painting
        Qian Li Jiang Shan Tu in the Palace Museum. This was pained by Wang
        Ximeng during the Northern Song Dynasty. This painting is a scroll of
        11.9 meters long and can be divided into six parts. It depicted the
        greatness of mountains and rivers by using a lot of Prussian blues.
        Besides landscape, there are also small boat, small houses, and people
        in the painting, so it can be viewed as a reflection of ancient
        Chineses' life during the Northern Song Dynasty. This magnificent and
        splendid painting is an important art piece in ancient Chinese art
        history.
